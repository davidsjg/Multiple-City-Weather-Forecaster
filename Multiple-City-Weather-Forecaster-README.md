Title: Multiple-City-Weather-Forecaster

Introduction: The goal of this weather website is to allow the user to search for various cities and have the current and future weather data for those cities displayed. Once a city is searched for, it is added to a search history list that remains active. Current weather data for the searched city is displayed, as well as a five-day weather forecast.

Technologies: HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, OpenWeatherMap.org

Launch: The page launches once a user enters a city and hits search. The user can then further interact with the website by either searching for new cities, or selecting a previously searched city from the search history section.

Scope of Funtionalities: The website allows the user to search for a city. This search stars an AJAX promise that allows the site to continue to load while the weather data is fetched. Once the weather data returns from Openweathermap.org, dynamic divs, containers, and variables are created and updated based on user selections/searches. This allows for minimal HTML markup and maximum JQuery modification/addition ease of use. The history is saved to local memory.

Problems Faced: Using the API and traversing through the data provided. Much repition early was cut down by the use of functions. Keeping everything neatly arranged while dynamically creating most elements was also a challenge.

Potential Future Plans: Possible external links to cities searched for, such as hotels and restaurants. More weather data, such as monthly trends.
